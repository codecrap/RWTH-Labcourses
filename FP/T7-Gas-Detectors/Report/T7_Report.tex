\section{Introduction}

The goal of this experiment is to get aquainted with gas detectors and to learn how to operate them. Furthermore we want to measure statistical distributions related to decay processes.

\subsection{Gas detectors}


By ionizing Atoms with a suitable gas, in our case Argon, we can detect ionized Radiation with a gas detector.
by entering the gas chamber, the charged particle generates an electron and an positive charged ion.
through an applied electric field, the electrons go to the anode and the ions to the cathode. this creates a current
that we can transform to a Voltage.
the total charge Q arriving at the anode depends on the counter voltage U 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/total.PNG}
\caption{Total charge versus counter voltage.}
\label{fig:Total}
\end{figure}

Proportional Counter:
We have a cylindrical gas chamber, where in the middle of the chamber is the anode wire and the cylinder Mantel
is the cathode
we can create an electrical Field E proportional to 1/r so near the wire we get a high field.
if we put a high voltage (1kV) through a Resistance we get a gas amplification near the anode.

A proportional counter is good for energy measurement because of the probability between magnitude of voltage and energy of the particle 
We use it for detection of alpha and beta particles


the characteristic curve is determined by puls rate in dependence of the applied voltage



only from a certain threshold voltage a certain plus height is reached so particle can be detected

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/prop.PNG}
\caption{Expected characteristic curve for proportional counter.}
\label{fig:Proportional}
\end{figure}


GM-Counter


the GM-Counter is a proportional counter with a higher voltage that generates a much stronger electrical field.
This creates UV Photons, it comes to an avalanche along the whole anode wire.
At the same time we have to quench the gas after ionization, otherwise the ions of the cathode activate new electrons.
for the quench we use in our case a quench gas 


the characteristic curve of a Geiger-Müller counter is:


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Geiger.PNG}
\caption{Expected characteristic curve for Geiger counter.}
\label{fig:Geiger}
\end{figure}


from a certain threshold voltage the puls height is still dependent of the energy of the particle  after a certain Geiger threshold UG the pluses 
are the same heights for all particles

\subsection{Statistics}

The first discrete distribution is the binomial distribution with the probability density:$$ P(k) = \frac{{n!}}{{k!\left( {n - k} \right)!}}p^k (1-p)^{n - k} = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c} n \\ k \\ \end{array}} \right)p^k (1-p)^{n - k}$$
the mean value of$\bar{k}=\mu=np$and the RMS of $\sigma=\sqrt{np(1-p)}$


for large $n$ and small probability $p$ we obtain the Poisson distribution with $np= \mu=const$:
$P\left( k \right) = \frac{{e^{ - \mu } \mu ^k }}{{k!}}$ with$\bar{k}=\mu$ and $\sigma=\sqrt{\mu}$
From this for large $\mu$($\mu>10$) we get the normal distribution:
$P(k) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{{{ - \left( {k - \mu } \right)^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - \left( {k - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {2\sigma ^2 }}}$
if$\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not independent, we get the relation $\sigma =\sqrt{\mu}$

Finally, there is the Exponential distribution:

$\rho(\Delta t)= Aexp(-A\Delta t)$

Furthermore, one considers the $\chi^2$ distribution as a quality for fitting to the measured value:
$\chi^2(a)=\sum{i=1}{n}{\dfrac{(x_i-y_i(a))^2}{\sigma_i^2}}$
For a good fit, the value should be in the range of degrees of freedom.
by minimizing the $\chi^2$ one gets the Parameter.
the value for the integrated $\chi^2$ distribution from Zero to infinity gives the probability for re-measurement 
a higher value for the $\chi^2$ it should therefore be very high, so one can say that the minimal $\chi^2$ was found .

\section{Measurments with the Geiger counter}

\subsection{Setup}

As probe we will use Sr90. The activity of the source on the day of the experiment is shown in \cref{tab:Activity}. When used, the probe is placed inside a sealed lead chamber whith the Geiger-Müller-counter. The signal goes through a multiplier before it is goes into the electronical counter. We also have an oscilloscope, a dead time stage and a 1-MHz-generator we can introduce to the circuit when needed.

\end{table}   

\subsection{Procedure}

First we placed a Sr90-Probe in a lead chamber and measured the count rate's dependence on the voltage.

Next we checked the intensity of the background, by measuring the pulse rate without a probe in the chamber and found it to be $\frac{4}{\SI{10}{s}}$.

Then, using the oscilloscope we produced a Stever diagram to estimate the dead time and the recover time.

Since we will need to use the dead time stage to find the resolution time of the counter, we first need to verify the electronically generated dead times indicated on it. We do this by connenting it to a 1-MHz-generator and writing down the count rates for each dead time.

Now we can make the pulses from the Geiger counter pass through the dead time stage. We measure the pulse rate for the large and the small dead time, writing down three pulse rate for each.

\subsection{Analysis}

\subsubsection{Characterization of dead time}

First of all we generated a puls of $1\,MHz$ with the generator
that is linked to the variable dead time stage($2\,ms$,$1\mu\,s$) and wrote down the count (counts over $2\,s$ measured $3$ times).
With
\begin{equation}
N =\frac{n_1}{1-n_1\cdot\tau_1}=\frac{n_2}{1-n_2\cdot\tau}
\end{equation}
we can correct the stage if we consider that the smaller stage is correct 
with a measured count rate of $10^6$ for $1\mu\,s$ and 
$519.67\pm0.07$ for $2\,ms$ we get a corrected stage of $1.92\,ms$.

Now we can calculate with the same method the resolution time of the GM-counter.
We consider that the real stage is between $\SI{1}{\micro s}$ and $\SI{2}{ms}$ with
\begin{equation}
\tau =\frac{1}{n_2}-\frac{1}{n_1}+\tau_1
\end{equation}
and $n_2=\SI{179.6\pm0.6}{s^{-1}}$ and $n_1=\SI{246.0\pm1.8}{s^{-1}}$ we got a resolution time of $\tau=\SI{422\pm35}{ms}$.

\subsubsection{Stever diagram}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/TEK0000.pdf}
\caption{Stever diagram with markers set to read dead time.}
\label{fig:SteverDead}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/F0001TEK.pdf}
\caption{Stever diagram with markers set to read recovery time.}
\label{fig:SteverRecovery}
\end{figure}

With a Stever diagram we can estimate the resolution time on the oscilloscope out of the dead time an the recovery time that we can read from the scope. 

The dead time is the distance between the main peak and the next incoming peak, during that time the GM-Counter can not detect anything.
We estimate the dead time with $\SI{224 \pm 4}{\micro s}$ (for that we read the dead time out of the steverdiagram 3 time with a min and max value and mean over all)
The recovery time is the distance bewteen main peak and the next main peak, we estimated it as $\SI{505\pm11}{\micro s}$ (same method as before).

\subsubsection{Characteristic curve of GM-Counter}
After the dead time correction we can now study the characteristic Geiger curve.
We plot the voltage (in 10 Volt steps) over the measured counts per 1s ($\frac{\mathrm{actual\,counts}}{10\,s}$).

With the calculated resolution time we can now correct the characteistic GM-curve for the detected counts with $N =\frac{n}{1-n\cdot\tau}$. 
For errors we used the uncertainties package for python, which calculates errors with gaussian propagation.

\section{Measurement of statistical distributions}

\subsection{Setup}

Since will still be using the setup of the Geiger counter for this part. 

\subsection{Procedure}

First we set the measurement, such that an average of at least 25 events were recorded per measurement, while the Sr-probe was in the detector. We found $10\,s$ to be a good interval. Then we measured the number of events per $10\,s$, 100 times.

Next we removed the probe from the chamber and set the measurement time, such that the average event count per measurement was at most 2. There we found $2\,s$ to be a good intervall. Then we measured the number of events per $2\,s$, 113 times.

Next we placed the probe in the chamber again and used the oscilloscope to take a shot of the pulses on a $50\,ms$ scale. We will use this data to measure the times between two consecutive events.

We repeated the last measurement with an alternative method: using the counter we recorded the counts per $0.1\,s$ 50 times.

\subsection{Analysis}

In \cref{fig:GaussHist} we see the recorded count rates for the Geiger counter with the Sr-probe in a histogramm, that vaguely resemble a gaussian distribution. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of our data and with those calculated our expected gauss distribution, according to
\begin{equation}
P(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp(-\frac{(k-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}).
\end{equation}
This expected curve is shown in \cref{fig:GaussFit} together with the normalized histogramm of the count rates. In the same figure we also plotted a gauss curve we fitted with the least square method with $\mu$ and $\sigma$ as free parameters. The mean values (including the error on mean) and standard deviations for both curves can be seen in \cref{tab:DistPara}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Geiger_gauss_fit.pdf}
\caption{Normalized histogram with expected and fitted gauss curves.}
\label{fig:GaussFit}
\end{figure}

We proceed analogously for the count rates of the empty Geiger counter. In \cref{fig:PoissonHist} we see the measured count rates and in \cref{fig:PoissonFit} we plotted the normalized histogramm, together with both the expected and the fitted poisson distribution
\begin{equation}
P(k) = \frac{\mu^k e^{-\mu}}{k!}.
\end{equation}
Of course here we only have one parameter, the mean value $\mu$, since the standard deviation is given by $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu}$. The mean values (including the error on mean) and standard deviations for both curves can be seen in \cref{tab:DistPara}. The errors on the standard deviations are come from the errors on the mean values through gaussian propagation.

\label{fig:ExpFit}
\end{figure}

To test the goodness of our predictions, we did a $\chi^2$ test for all of the distributions. We only used bins with more than 4 events. The resulting $\chi^2$ and $P$ values are listed in \cref{tab:DistGood}.

\section{Measurements with the proportional counter}

\subsection{Setup}

The methan-gas-flow proportional counter is flushed continuously with a argon-methan mixture. We will analyse a Am241, as well as a C14 probe. The activity of the sources on the day of the experiment is shown in \cref{tab:Activity}. When used, the probes are placed inside a sample changer. The elecrtonic setup is equivalent to the one for the Geiger counter.

\subsection{Procedure}

First we insert the Am241-probe inside the sample changer and proceed to measure the pulse rate as a function of the voltage. For each voltage, we also write down the puls heights, which we get from the oscilloscope. Based on their fluctuation we assumed a global error of \SI{2}{mV}.

We repeat the same measurement with the C14-probe and with an empty sample changer.

\subsection{Analysis}

To plot the characteristic curve we use a logarithmic scale, since the range of the count rates stretches over several orders of magnitude. This scale allows us to clearly see the $\alpha$-plateau and the $(\alpha+\beta)$-plateau.
